*** INTRO ***
Welcome to my WIP GM Helper.  Current features:
 - Initiative list sorting 
 - Monster HP and Turn tracker
 - Simple Dice Roller

*** BASIC USE ***

So, it is pretty self explanitory, but documentation is always a good thing.  Basically, you can enter your players and their initiatives in the left column and the monsters and their initiatives in the right column.  Click "Start Combat" and the "Initiative List" will be populated based on the data entered.  In the event of initiative ties, players are given priority over monsters and randomly ordered if the same.  If you want to easily clear either the player or monster list, you can click the approptiate "Clear X List" button to do just that.

The HP fields can be used to track HP.  Simply click in the field to edit it. 

You can access the Dice Roller by clicking the "Dice Roller" tab next to "Initiative".  Currently only the basic roller is available but a more sophisticated, customizable one is in the works.  You can specify the number of dice you want to roll in the # field and any modifier you want to add to the roll in the "Modifier" field.  Then click on any dice to roll and the result will be at the top of the list on the right.

To exit the program, just click the X in the top corner.  Stupid exit button was giving me problems, so I deleted it.  Just to show it who was boss.

*** KNOWN ISSUES ***

Please be sure to have a name AND an initiative entered before starting combat, or weird things may happen.  If they do happen, don't worry.  You can click "End Combat" to clear the Initiative List and fix any mistakes; however, this will reset the turn tracker.

The helper does not randomize the order of player/player or monster/monster initiative ties.  Best practice for now is to list the players and monsters in descending priority in the columns.
